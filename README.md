# SVM Classification on Iris Dataset

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to classify iris flower species based on their physical features using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

## Algorithm Used
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Dataset
- Iris Dataset (scikit-learn)
- Number of samples: 150
- Number of features: 4
- Target classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

## Steps Involved
1. Load the Iris dataset
2. Perform data preprocessing
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train the SVM classifier
5. Evaluate model performance

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python svm.py
Conclusion

The SVM classifier effectively classified iris flower species with high accuracy, demonstrating its suitability for multi-class classification problems.
